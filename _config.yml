# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.
# Zubair's note - we're keeping this text. Might be useful for fachhas.

  Turning ideas into reality is the sorcery that is best left to entrepreneurs.
  And we love helping out in spreading this art, because we believe that we need
  to realise and utilise the potential of the youth to reach new levels and open
  up new possibilities. For this we conduct numerous workshops, seminars, events
  and interactive sessions with eminent entrepreneurs, thus, providing the students
  exposure to the entrepreneurial world along with a platform to work on the live
  projects from start-ups.
