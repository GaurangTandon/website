The semester was off to a great start with the E-Cell introducing itself to the youngest batch of IIIT-H as part of their induction into the system.
The students were briefed on what E-Cell is and what it does. This was followed by a game where students had to form a team and come forward to pitch an idea of a product chosen by them to the audience.
The competitive and fun-filled session ended with one team emerging as the winners and the other teams being rewarded for their will to come forward and participate.
The event succeeded in creating a positive impression in the minds of the students on entrepreneurship and inducing a will in them to join the E-Cell IIIT-H team.
