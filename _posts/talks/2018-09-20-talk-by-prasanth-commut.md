Prasanth Garapati is an IIIT-H Alumnus and the CEO and Founder of Commut, a Hyderabad-based bus-shuttle service app and one of the most successful startups from our college. Commut was recently acquired by the Dubai based transportation network company Careem, which has its presence in over 100 cities in 14 countries.


The highly interactive session went on for more than an hour and a half with Mr. Prasanth and the other co-founders of Commute narrating the journey of Commute from an idea of a few students to an immensly successful company worth millions of dollars at the time it was acquired by Careem. The talk helped the students dive directly into the world of entrepreneurship and learn more about the challenges and risks involved along with the sense of satisfcation and freedom that comes with it.
