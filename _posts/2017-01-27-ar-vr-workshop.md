  Want to be the next Elon Musk? Or want to do something in unexplored fields just like SpaceX and Tesla? So far, our experience with the internet has been two-dimensional at best. But all of that is about to change. Virtual reality is going to upend the world and cause a monumental shift in the way we surf, shop and experience the web. It will dramatically transform the way we learn, live, communicate and connect with others around the world. E-Cell, IIIT Hyderabad along with Felicity, IIIT Hyderabad present an Augmented Reality - Virtual Reality workshop. This will be a special workshop curated by Vamrrâ„¢ which is a pioneer in the field of Virtual Reality. We would have a panel discussion on AR-VR from the most basic questions in our mind to actually getting a hands on experience of it. So come, live the future with us. Limited seats available, so buy your ticket asap.
