Turning ideas into reality is the sorcery that is best left to entrepreneurs. And we love helping out in spreading this art, because we believe that we need to realise and utilise the potential of the youth to reach new levels and open up new possibilities. For this we conduct numerous workshops, seminars, events and interactive sessions with eminent entrepreneurs, thus, providing the students exposure to the entrepreneurial world along with a platform to work on the live projects from start-ups.
